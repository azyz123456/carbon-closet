# Hackathon Spring 2023

## Inspiration 

The clothing industry has caused detrimental environmental damages, including global warming, eutrophication, water scarcity, resource depletion and chemistry use. People are unaware of where their own clothes are sourced from. We decided a great way to educate people on this topic is to create a chrome extension. While viewers go online shopping. The chrome extension will list each textile item that makes up the fashionable item on the screen. It will then list the environmental damage that come with the item. In addition, we wanted companies to be held accountable for their sources and environmental impact. We noticed that third party sites tend to have corruption such as manipulating data. Hence, we stored fashionable items as NFTSs an its impact score as a trait, to create transparency and permanency. 


## What it does

When the chrome extension is run while a user has opened an Amazon link for a piece of clothing, it will display the global warming, eutrophication, water scarcity, resource depletion, and chemistry scores of the clothing calculated based on the materials used to create it. It then displays the score placed on a scale gradient of “good” to “bad” scores.
